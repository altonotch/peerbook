<h1>Greetings & Salutations!</h1>
<p>Welcome to peerbook a service devleoped for  
<a http="https://terminal7.dev">Termainl7</a> users. 
Each Peerbook user controls a private address book of servers and clients.
peerbook started as yet-another-WebRTC-signaling-server and grew to a protocol and a
system that lets you never key another IP address or copy a key ever again.
</p>
<p>
Changes to the address book are authorzied on a webpage with an "Update" button
at the bottom. Above it, there's a list of peers name, fingerprint, kind and a
checkbox to [un]verify. This page works only when the url ends with a valid token.
Redis helps us ensure, tokens live for just 5 minute. A link with the token is 
emailed to the user whenever a new peer wants to authenticate.
</p>
<p>
To review your peer list, please enter your email and we will forge and send a token.
